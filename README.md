advancedmaps
============

Advanced map visualizations for splunk. This app is based on the HERE maps app.  
But only contains the visualizations parts, not the reverse geocoder.  
This app uses the Google Maps javascript API.

The development for this app is on hold now as the Google Maps api has very limited support for customized visualization of markers.
